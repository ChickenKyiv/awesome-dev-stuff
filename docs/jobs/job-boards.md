Here is a set of different websites that can help you to get a job in a tech company. They are maybe not very popular right now. Or very local. But there you'll have less competition, so it worse exploring.



If you also want to get more information about working in tech(right now there a lot of changes) - below I put a list of articles, that might be interested for you to read.


First Place to look is AngelList Jobs section https://angel.co/jobs

I don't want to list Linkedin as place for find a tech job - because it's very hard there. Yes, you can apply some tricks there. And for most positions as other places you'll need to have a Linkedin profile... But from my perspective - LI is a better place for recruiters, rather than for someone who looking for a job. Usually it will work in this way - you find a job and working there for some months. Then recruiters will start to add you to their networks and try to "steal" you.
