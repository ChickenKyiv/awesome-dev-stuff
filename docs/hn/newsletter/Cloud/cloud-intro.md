Today I want to talk about cloud services from an indie hacker perspective. I'm a fan of trying things quickly. If you doing it slowly -> then you can be wrong for a lot of cases. MVP cases. And waste a lot of time catching ghosts. 
I'm using Github for saving publicly my "side-projects". Maybe the term sandbox is better. A lot of indie hackers using Heroku + Mongo/Postgres + free domain for deploying their projects online.
I use it for my recipe API project. But then I stopped. Not sure why. Maybe because deploying is not the major problem that you need to solve...
But if I want to have a more scalable and reliable model for my project - I need to prepare. There are 2 major players in the field. 
"Cloud Whales" can help you as a startup founder. AWS and Google Cloud. If you bootstrapping - both have plans for startups. You can start with free plans and break things.
AWS is dominating at Makers community. a lot of people use it for quick sandbox setups.
Tons of boilerplates will deploy your image at some random URL in 2 minutes. And it's huge. Imagine the same pace 10y ago.
Still, Google has their own cool features. Machine learning tools for example. And I want to put my nose into it.
I love Google login. But I like to try Amazon Cognito too. Because I hate to code sign up forms ;) Cognito doing a great job. but I don't want to be bound to them.

One more thing. Amazon has less "human" support. Maybe it varies from case to case. Not sure.
When I reach Google Startup's representative - he was very polite to me and try to help me as he can. I wanted to use their OCR service for parsing grocery lists from Pinterest.
I ran away and not reply - so my application was rejected later. BUT! the team gives me a lot of their personal time. thanks for that!

I just started my relationship with the "cloud". And the best way for me to learn? I read insights from experienced engineers. So here we have a great collection of articles below.
If you miss some of these stories before - let's read them together!
